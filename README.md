A personal website deployed as a Flask app instance on a VPS.

## General Information

I believe everyone should have a personal website and decided it would be more
fun to build it from scratch than use one of the many hosting services. The
goal of the website is to act as a mix of CV, portfolio and a creative hub.

### Technologies

- Python =3.8
- Flask >=3.0

### Features

- A welcome page with links to my socials.
- A sticky mobile-friendly navbar.
- An animated favicon.
- A blogging module with Markdown-support.
- A user authentication system for admin access.
- Basic logging of website activity including hit statistics.
- A full testing suite with Pytest.
- More features coming. See [Project Status](#project-status)

## Setup

Setup is not required unless you want to explore the dev branch and/or
[contribute](#contributing).

### Usage

1. Go to [www.theodorblom.com](https://www.theodorblom.com) and enjoy!

### Contributing

If you found an error or have suggestions for further development, please
submit an issue! <3

To contribute you have to set up your own instance of the app. Settings for
your instance are made in the 'config.py' file in the 'instance' directory.
Default development settings are found in 'src/app/config.py'.

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Theeoi/theodorblom.com`
2. Go into the directory `cd theodorblom.com`
3. Create a Python 3.8 virtual environment `python3.8 -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the venv and install requirements `pip install .[dev]`
5. Run the app `flask run`
6. View the webpage at [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Please note:
To create an account to store in the database, remove the `@login_required` on
the create_user route. Remember to revert the changes after storing the user in
the database.

## Project Status

The website is up but is being developed sporadically.
